Hello! I am Abdus, a developer living in India. And I am glad that you're interested in reading about me üòÉ

First off, I am not really good at explaining things or writing stories or even talking about myself. So, please pardon me if I sound strange at any point!

I am a student learning, full-stack web development. I am mostly self-taught(though I am pursuing a CS degree). I teach myself how to code from around the web. I am grateful to websites like [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/), [W3Schools](https://w3schools.org), [freeCodeCamp](https://freecodecamp.org) etc.

I love coding and building things in React and NodeJS. I use MongoDB(NoSQL is fun!) and Express framework to build web-servers and APIs(Express, because it is the simplest back-end framework to work with).

I have been using GNU/Linux for a few years. And I love it! I started my _Linux_ journey with Ubuntu, tried many other distributions like Linux Mint, Manjaro etc. Among all of them, I feel like Arch & Arch-based distributions are batter. But that's only my point of view.
