Hello! I am Abdus, a developer living in India. And I am glad that you're interested in knowing more about me ðŸ˜ƒ

First off, I am not really good at explaining things or writing stories or even talking about myself. So, please pardon me if I sound strange at any point!

I am a student learning full-stack web development in Node JS and React. I am mostly self-taught(I am pursuing a degree in CS, but that's as useless as _The Ropeless Skipping Rope_). I teach myself how to code from around the web. I am grateful to websites like [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/), [W3Schools](https://w3schools.org), [freeCodeCamp](https://freecodecamp.org) etc.

### Things I love

- __MERN__: `mongo-express-react-node`, this is what I do all day ðŸ˜¸
- __JAM__: Latest trend in web development. (If you don't know what JAM Stack is, check [this video](https://youtu.be/Y8PXMbr0Kqo) on YouTube)
- __Linux__: My favorite OS family. Currently on [Manjaro](http://manjaro.org/)
- __Open-Source__: I love Open-Source and occasionally contribute to Open-Source Softwares. Check out all my contributions [here](https;//github.com/thisisabdus)

### Resources I learn from

- [The Complete Web Developer Zero to Mastery](https://www.udemy.com/the-complete-web-developer-zero-to-mastery/) (Special thanks to [Andrei  Neagoie](https://twitter.com/AndreiNeagoie))

- [Free Code Camp](https://freecodecamp.org) (Org that teaches you how to code for free)
- [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) (Lots of web development Docs)
